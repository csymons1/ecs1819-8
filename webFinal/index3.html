            Swimming
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            I have been swimming ever since I was 3, however when I was 8, I joined a competetive swim team, the Lakeview Wahoos (named after a species of sailfish). This team was based at a YMCA, and we practiced in a 20 yard pool with five lanes. It wasn't the most competetive team, but while I was on it, I went to two state and many regional competitions with some other members of my team. I had a lot of fun, but the lack of funding and other factors caused the team to fall apart. After that, I joined the Gill Park Gators team, a park district team close to my house. I did not enjoy the few months I spent on that team, as it was overcrowded and generally a bad pool. After a shor dip in which I didn't swim, I ended up on the Latin Romans team, which was a great fit. It was just serious enough for me to improve my stroke and form and do well at meets without being overcrowded or no fun. On this team, I went to a zone competition for the 50 butterfly, a national meet where the best swimmers from over 15 states from central North America came together to compete. However, after more than 2 years on this team, I quit swimming to pursue my interests in other sports.

               Before swimming and starting again this spring of 2019, I have played soccer. It was only for enjoyment and exercise, because it was just a kids' league. For a while, I would have soccer games every few Saturdays and I enjoyed it a lot, but dropped it to do swimming. Now, as an eigth grader, I will be joining the Lane girls' soccer team. I also did track and cross country for a while, however I found it boring. In spite of this, the Decatur girls' cross country team won city and came in third for the two years I was on it, and continued this succsess long after I left. Lastly, this fall I began rowing, a sport I wasn't sure about at first, but with the help of my friends on the team I grew to enjoy it! I will also be doing rowing again this spring.
