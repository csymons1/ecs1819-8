        About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
       My name is Chloe Symons, I am 13 years old and I attend the Lane Tech Academic Center in Chicago, as an eight grader. I live with my mom, dad, brother, and 2 cats in Lakeview near Wrigley Field. My brithday is August 31st, and I was born in 2005, making me a year and a half younger than my brother. My mom was born and raised in Chicago, but my dad was born in Miami and moved to Illinois for college. Currently, I enjoy birdwatching, drawing, science olympiad, rowing, and soccer, some of which are activities I do while at school, some of which are outside of it.
