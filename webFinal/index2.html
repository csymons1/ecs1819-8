            Decatur
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            The school I attened from kindergarten to sixth grade was Decatur Classical School. It is a selective enrollment school that goes from kindergarten to 6th grade, one of the only schools of that type in the city. There, I learned Latin all seven years, a base language for all the romance languages you can take in high school. I took the baseline math, literature, social studies, and science classes as well as art and music every year. During this time, I went to the city history fair competition, competed in Latin Olympics. I also kept up straight A's throughout most of my time there, and made a lot of great friends, some of whom would follow me into my next school.

            Lane Tech
        </h2>
        
            <p>
                I got into Lane, my first choice of schools, in my sixth grade year when I was eleven. Two of my best friends also got into the school (the academic center), and I was excited to start my time at a new school after seven years with basically the same 28 people. It was a hard adjustment from a school that was only one hallway to a school with four floors and a million different classes, but I enjoyed it in the end and I am happy with my school choice, as I am an eighth grader and Lane's academic center now. The work was and is challenging, and the homework is definitley a bigger burden than it was, but I maintain good grades and I have learned a lot. I will most likely continue into Lane's high school when I transition into freshman year, and will finish many of my high school credits early, another plus to me attending this school. You can see an example of a project I completed as a part of my computer science class right...
